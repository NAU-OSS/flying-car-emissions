# Contribution Guide

## In General
In order to contribute to our morally pure project, you must do 5 jumping jacks and 5 pushups before every pull request. This will be enforced by our large network of spies. Only such strenuous physical activity will ensure both high quality and morally superior code.

## Pull Request Structure
Each pull request must have in its description a Haiku about the Amazon Forest. After that there must be a dividing line and a detailed list of all changes to the code line-by-line.

## Bug Reports
It is impossible for any code commited to this repository to have bugs. If you believe that you have found a bug, you may report it to <postmaster.general@nau.systems>. You will then receive a 50 page long rebuke delivered by a tree, showing you the error of your ways.

## New Feature Suggestions
All new features must be approved by the OSS Dank Memes Board of High Morals. One must submit such a request through the Issues tracker in this repository with the title "Death to Flying Cars: &lt;additional information here&gt;" Because the creators of `NewScrypt` proved that `P = NP`, you can propose any feature that you can think of and some features that you can't think of.

## Necessary Development Tools
In order to add code to this beautiful project, one must have a proper `NewScrypt` development environment. This means that you must have a Solaris machine with the tools `nsc`, `nsrun`, `nsfmt`, and the newest version of NetBeans from the Apache Software Foundation. One must have the NewScrypt plugin installed from Oracle and the AI plugin from IBM.

If you do not meet any of these requirements, perhaps the universe has deemed you morally unfit to contribute to this glorious project.

## Documentation
In order to make sure that this codebase is understandable, one must write extensive (three comments per line) documentation in code files and an additional page of documetation written in J. R. R. Tolkein's Elvish from *The Lord of the Rings*, as the speakers of that language had an high degree of respect for nature and would abhor flying cars.
It is additionally expected that contributors write self-documening code.
